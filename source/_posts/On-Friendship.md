I finished the last week of my summer internship at Facebook last Friday. I can't help but feel nostalgic and sad that another chapter in my life is coming to a close. My housing complex that up until recently had been full of new friends I had made now seems eerily still. I'm one of the last ones to leave for home. My thoughts drift. *How long will it be until I see these friends once more? Which friends will I never get to cross paths with again?*

These feelings are all but uncommon to me. In each of my previous internships and school years I've felt these pangs of bittersweet. *I wish my internship was longer. I wish this small, ephemeral portion of my life could last. I wish these people didn't have to graduate and move away.* Perhaps this is all a lesson in growing up. Maybe it's to show us that, *"Hey, you can find happiness no matter where you go, so don't be afraid to leave this behind."*

Yesterday evening I went up to the city for a spontaneous picnic and catch-up session with a childhood friend. I tried to toss my apple cider into the trash can but missed, spilling onto our shoes instead. We doubled over in laughter at how ridiculous I looked. While tears came out my eyes and my abs ached, I slowly realized: *holy shit, this is awesome.* I felt more like an adult every day, but in that moment I knew that some of my friendships would last forever. Here we were 3,000 miles from home yet it felt like nothing had changed. On my ride home I messaged my friend to let him know much I appreciated him. That inspired me to write this post for all my friends.

Regardless of how short I've known you, I want to make it known just how greatly I value the kickass friendships I've made over the years. You guys brighten my life and challenge me to be a better person every day. I'm happy to have friendships worth missing.
