(Note: This has been sitting in my drafts for too long, decided releasing it later was better than never doing it at all)

This last weekend I went to UPenn to participate in the 2015 Pennapps hackathon with another friend. Going into the event, we had no idea of what we wanted to build and little experience with the hardware we picked up. After brainstorming for a few hours, we decided to make a virtual reality Fruit Ninja game using the Oculus Rift and a Myo. 48 hours later, while giving a demo of our game to over a thousand people, we ran into one of my most dreaded fears: technical difficulties.

In the end the moment of sheer panic was worth it, we ended up taking third place. Unfortunately, not owning a Myo and Oculus Rift leave me unable to continue working on the game. If you want a copy of the code, shoot me an email @ <hello@michaelyliu.com>
