For the past week I've been learning the Unity game engine and working on a simple ping pong game. I can see now why there's so much praise for Unityâ€”the tools are easy to pick up but very powerful, the documentation is thorough, and the potential for what you can make is practically limitless.

I tried experimenting with Unity's built in physics to achieve the feel I wanted from the ball, but I ended up writing my own physics instead.

I was playing around with letting the player move forward and backwards as well and Unity actually surprised me by doing this!

My goals for this project are to have a local two player game with certain powerups like faster hits, ball spins, etc. More to come!
